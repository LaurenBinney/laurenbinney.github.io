        Hi! I'm Lauren! I am a student at Boise State University studying integrated media and strategic communication. 
        I am also earning a certificate in digital media from Boise State and a graphic design certification from the New York Institute of Art & Design.
        This is a portfolio website to specifically highlight the PR work I have produced in my three years at Boise State.  </p>


    <p>
        I am a dedicated student with a passion for digital media & design. I believe in the power of visual communication to make information accessible & understandable. 
        I desire to work efficiently & creatively, always looking to improve in every aspect of my work. On any given day, you might find me hanging out in a coffee shop, reading a book, or going on a long walk with friends. 
        The world has such beautiful things to offer, and I love incorporating that in my work, be it in relating to the people around me, capturing it in photos, 
        or accentuating people's passion in my designs. 
  
    </p>
