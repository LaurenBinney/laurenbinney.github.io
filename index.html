<p>To clear your head and get some easy exercise, the only thing that beats
     walking is getting out on the water. I’m lucky to live close enough to a
     lake that I can go for a sunset kayak a few days each week, where I watch 
     birds and sometimes just bring a snack, drop an anchor, and float for a little bit.</p>


<p>I finally bought my own kayak a few years back, and I have absolutely zero regrets. 
    It turned kayaking from a thing I did when the weather was good and the rental place was open, 
    to something I can just do anytime. Here’s what you need to know if you’d like to join me.</p>


<h2>Rent a kayak before you buy one</h2>

<p>Before buying a kayak—which is a good option if you know you’ll use it often—it’s smart to rent one 
    a few times. If you don’t have a way to store and transport it, renting may be your only option 
    anyway. (Although there are inflatable and foldable models, but more about those another time.)</p>

<p>A chiller experience is to rent a kayak from a place on a lake and go out for an hour, or whatever 
    you feel like it. Where I live, nearly every state park has a lake, and nearly every lake has a 
    place where you can rent canoes, single and double kayaks, and sometimes an assortment of other 
    watercraft like rowboats, paddleboats, and stand-up paddleboards.</p>

<p>The place will give you the equipment you need (boat, paddle, lifejacket), give you a crash
     course in how to propel and steer your boat, and warn you about any parts of the lake you 
     should stay away from.</p>

<h2>Will you get wet on a kayak?</h2>

<p>The inside of a sit-in kayak is a relatively dry place, but no guarantees. My personal rule of 
    thumb when planning for an outing on the lake is to assume that one of these days I might flip 
    the boat over and dump myself and my belongings overboard. This hasn’t happened yet, but I’m
     prepared.</p>

<p>It’s also just smart to dress for getting wet, since there will be drips from the paddle and
     you may end up needing to wade in the water to get into and out of your boat.</p>

<p>On a typical day I’ll wear shorts and waterproof sandals, and dress like normal (t-shirt or whatever)
     from the thighs up. I clip my car keys to my belt. I put my phone in a plastic bag and tuck 
     it into a zippered pocket or fanny pack, or else I leave it in the car. Sometimes I’ll bring 
     an old phone, since even a deactivated phone can still call 911 in an emergency.</p>

<h2>How do you paddle, anyway?</h2>
<p>Your first time in a kayak, you will be focused on practical 
     considerations like how the hell do I steer this thing. It’s okay if you don’t think any
     further ahead than that. (Here, by the way, is a video showing you how to steer this thing.)</p>

<p>If you don’t care how far or how fast you go, you can get by without any instruction.
     You certainly don’t need lessons just to tootle around a calm lake. But if you want 
     to move yourself expertly around the water, or if you intend to use paddling as a workout, 
     learning some technique will help.</p>

<p>A proper paddle stroke uses your core and your lats (upper back) to pull the paddle toward 
    you while you brace your body against the boat. You may also have sore deltoids (shoulders)
    your first time from the work you’re doing in raising the free end of the paddle out of the
    water. All told, a hard paddling session is somewhere in between a cardio and a strength 
    workout.</p>

<h2>What should I do in a kayak?</h2>

<p>Once you get used to the mechanics of paddling, you can use your little boat to go exploring. 
    Even on the small lake in my county park, I know that if I start at one end I have a few options
    for where to go, and I may see different wildlife in different parts of the lake.</p>

<p>Watching nature is the best part for me, because I like birds and cool animals and I’ll often see 
    ones on the lake that I don’t see in my backyard just a few miles away. There’s often a great
    blue heron standing in the shadows somewhere, maybe green herons hunting for fish down at the 
    swampy end of the lake, a colony of swallows darting around catching bugs, and the occasional 
    swimming muskrat. The other day, an osprey circled above me a few times before finally splashing 
    in to grab a fish. One time I saw a dark brown shape swimming in front of me, and I quietly paddled 
    closer, only to see it dive down and slap the water with its tail. A beaver!</p>
